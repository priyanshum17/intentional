# Intentional: In-Browser Markdown Editor

**A distraction-free markdown editor for the intentional writer.**


Intentional is a minimalist, in-browser markdown editor designed for deep work. It's built for software engineers, writers, and anyone who wants to focus on their writing without the clutter of a traditional word processor.
